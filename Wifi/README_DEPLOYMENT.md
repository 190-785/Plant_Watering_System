## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🔘 Button Controls (D2)
```
Triple Press (3x in 2 sec) → WiFi Reset Portal
Long Press (5+ seconds)    → Clear Fault
Short Press (quick click)  → Manual Water
```

### 💡 LED Status Indicators (D3)
```
Portal Active  → Fast double-blink
Connecting     → Fast single blink  
Online         → Slow heartbeat
Offline        → Slow blink
Pumping        → Solid on
Fault          → Error blink
Button Press   → Quick flash feedback
```

### 🆔 Device Identification
```cpp
deviceId = "ESP8266_AABBCCDDEEFF"  // From MAC address
```
- Unique per device
- Used in all Firestore paths
- No hardcoded user IDs

### 🗂️ Firestore Structure
```
plantData/
  └── ESP8266_AABBCCDDEEFF/
      ├── (live status document)
      ├── logs/{timestamp}/
      ├── config/settings/
      └── commands/pending/
```

### 🛡️ Pump Safety System
- **Minimum interval enforcement** (default: 60 sec for testing)
- **No-effect detection** (monitors moisture before/after)
- **Automatic fault locking** (after 2 consecutive failures)
- **Multiple clear methods** (button, web, remote)
- **Persistent state** (survives reboot)

### 📁 Persistent Storage
```
/config.json       → WiFi & Firebase credentials
/pump_state.json   → Pump history & fault state
```

### 🌐 WiFi Management
- **Smart retry** with exponential backoff (1h → 6h → 24h)
- **Non-blocking portal** (5-minute timeout)
- **Offline-first** (core functions work without WiFi)
- **Auto-reconnect** on network recovery

### 🖥️ Web Interface
```
http://{device-ip}/
├── /              → HTML dashboard
├── /status        → JSON status
├── /water         → Manual water
├── /clearFault    → Clear fault
└── /resetWiFi     → Reset config
```

### 🔄 Remote Control
Your web app can control device via Firestore:
- **Update config** → Device syncs every 30 seconds
- **Clear faults** → Command polling every 30 seconds
- **Monitor status** → `lastSeen` heartbeat every 10 seconds

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start (3 Steps)
```bash
# 1. Backup current code
cp src/main.cpp src/main_backup.cpp

# 2. Deploy new code
cp src/main_new.cpp src/main.cpp

# 3. Build and upload
pio run --target upload && pio device monitor
```

### What to Expect
1. **First boot** → WiFi portal starts automatically
2. **Connect to "Irrigation-Setup"** (password: plant123456)
3. **Configure WiFi** → Device saves and connects
4. **Serial output** → Shows initialization and status
5. **LED indicates state** → Online = slow heartbeat
6. **Web interface** → Access at device IP shown in serial

---

## 📊 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Hardware Verification
1. Test LED patterns (all 8 should display correctly)
2. Test button (triple, long, short press)
3. Test pump activation (should see relay click)
4. Test moisture sensor (readings change in water vs air)

### Phase 2: Safety Logic
1. Trigger auto-water by drying sensor
2. Try manual water too soon (should be denied)
3. Remove water reservoir and trigger 2 auto-waters
4. Verify fault locks (LED shows error pattern)
5. Clear fault with long press

### Phase 3: Connectivity
1. Verify WiFi connection on boot
2. Disconnect router, verify offline operation
3. Reconnect router, verify auto-reconnect
4. Check Firebase console for logs

### Phase 4: Remote Control
1. Update config in Firestore, verify device syncs
2. Trigger fault, send clearFault command
3. Monitor lastSeen timestamp for heartbeat
4. Check historical logs collection

---

## 🔧 Configuration (Testing Values)

Current defaults are **minimal for testing**:

```cpp
PUMP_RUN_TIME = 2000;          // 2 seconds
MIN_INTERVAL_SEC = 60;         // 1 minute
MAX_NO_EFFECT_REPEATS = 2;     // 2 failures
PUMP_SETTLE_MS = 10000;        // 10 seconds
```

**Adjust via Firestore after testing:**
```javascript
// Write to: plantData/{deviceId}/config/settings
{
  pumpRunTime: 5000,       // 5 seconds
  minIntervalSec: 600,     // 10 minutes
  dryThreshold: 520,
  wetThreshold: 420
}
```

Device will sync within 30 seconds.

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Device won't connect to WiFi
→ Triple-press button to force portal mode

### Pump won't activate
→ Check ULN2003 wiring, verify GND and COM connections

### LED doesn't show patterns
→ Check polarity (long leg to D3, short leg to GND)

### Button doesn't respond  
→ Verify D2 connection, check serial output when pressing

### Firestore writes fail
→ Check Firebase credentials, verify internet connection

### Fault won't clear
→ Hold button for full 5 seconds, check serial output
